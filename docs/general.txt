The "core" is the central hub of the OS, and is usually referenced by the character "|".
It contains all devices that the OS supports.

Filesystem paths are structured like this:

|Device/Directory/Subdirectory/file

For example:

|B/cfg/options.txt



A volume letter is assigned to each partition that the system recognizes.
